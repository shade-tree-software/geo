# geo

This is a game which uses Google Street View to explore cities and towns around the world.  In some ways it is similar to geoguessr, but the options are different.  The biggest difference is that the user can limit the random geolocation to large cities if she is tired of always being dumped into Siberia or the Australian Outback.
